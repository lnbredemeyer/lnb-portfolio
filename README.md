## Description

- Homework one was to create an online portfolio with work samples.

- We had to create HTML and CSS from scratch.

## Usage

* FOR an employee to deem me employable, I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
* WHEN they load my portfolio,
* THEY are presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
* WHEN they click one of the links in the navigation
* THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* WHEN they click on the link to the section about my work
* THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
* WHEN they are presented with the developer's first application
* THEN the application's image should be larger in size than the others
* WHEN they click on the images of the applications
* THEN they am taken to that deployed application
* WHEN they resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
* THEN they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
